# PIAPA MOBILE APPLICATION

This is a mobile application designed to help users learn the Tahitian language in a fun and interactive way. It uses React Native and Expo AV for the frontend and audio handling respectively.

## Features

The main feature of this app is the `Piapa` component. This component displays a series of images related to the Tahitian language, each associated with a specific sound. The images are displayed using a swiper component, allowing users to swipe through different images.

When a user taps on an image, the app plays the corresponding sound, aiding in the auditory learning of the language. This interactive approach helps users to learn the pronunciation and context of Tahitian words and phrases.
